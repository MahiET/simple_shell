.SH NAME

.B simple_shell - hsh

- command line interpreter or shell

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B  ./hsh

.I (no options yet)

.SH DESCRIPTION

The shell is a command line interface (CLI) program that takes commands from the keyboard and give
s them to the operating system to perform.

.SH ARGUMENTS

From input, the first argument is assumed to be an executable command file. It follows the parameters taken by that particular command.

.B hsh

is the executable that will interpret the command. It executes it and then, exit. With exit, an exit status returns with the s.TH HSH 1

.SH NAME

hsh \- Simple Shell	

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B hsh

[command] [options ...]

.SH COPYRIGHT

hsh \- is a holberton school first trimester project

.SH DESCRIPTION

.B hsh
is a shell command interpreter that executes command read from the standard input or from file.

.B hsh

is intend to be a clone of the standard command interpreter of 

.B Unix
and 

.B Unix-like

system.

.SH OPTIONS

A  simple command is a sequence of optional variable assignments followed by blank-separated wordsand redirections, 

and terminated by a control operator.  The first word specifies the command to be

executed, and is passed as argument zero.  The remaining words are passed as arguments to the invo

ked command.

.PP

The return value of a simple command is its exit status, or 128+n if the command is terminated by signal n.

.SS

Piplines

A pipeline is a sequence of one or more commands separated by one of the control operators | or |&

.  The format for a pipeline is:

.PP

[command [..ARGS]] [| - |&] [command2 [..ARGS]]

.PP

The standard output of command is connected via a pipe to the standard input of command2.  This connection is performed before any redirections specified by the command (see REDIRECTION below).

If

|&  is  used,  command's standard error, in addition to its standard output, is connected to comma

nd2's standard input through the pipe; it is shorthand for 2>&1 |.  This implicit redirection of t

he standard error to the standard output is performed after any redirections specified by the command.

.SS Lists

A list is a sequence of one or more pipelines separated by one of the operators ;, &, &&, or ||, a

nd optionally terminated by one of ;, &, or <newline>.

Of these list operators, && and || have equal precedence, followed by ; and &, which have equal pr

ecedence.

A sequence of one or more newlines may appear in a list instead of a semicolon to delimit commands
.

.PP

If  a command is terminated by the control operator &, the shell executes the command in the backg

round in a subshell.  The shell does not wait for the command to finish, and the return status is 0.

Commands separated by a ; are executed sequentially; the shell waits for each command to terminate

in turn.  The return status is the exit status of the last command executed.

AND and OR lists are sequences of one or more pipelines separated by the && and || control operato

rs, respectively.  AND and OR lists are executed with left associativity.  An AND list has the form

.PP

command1 && command2

.PP

command2 is executed if, and only if, command1 returns an exit status of zero.

.PP

An OR list has the form:

.PP

command1 || command2

.PP

command2 is executed if and only if command1 returns a non-zero exit status.  The return status of

AND and OR lists is the exit status of the last command executed in the list.
